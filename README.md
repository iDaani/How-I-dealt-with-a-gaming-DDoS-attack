# How I dealt with a gaming DDoS attack

This repository contains the powerpoint presentation I gave as part of my personal projects showcase at my placement. It was a splendid time giving this presentation as it allowed me to recall the curious technological things I did when I first started my adventures with Computers and also to refresh my knowledge.

This presentation essentially covers:

 - About DDos, types of DDos, different layers of network security
 - How DDos attack happens and possible ways to mitigate them
 - Personal experience of a corporate-level DDoS attack on one of the gaming servers I used to administrate
 - Detailed explanation of the gaming server
 - Step-by-step information on how the attack happened
 - My personal workaround on how I dealt with the DDos attack
 - Root-causes and solutions to the attack and the outcomes of it

This is all taken from my personal experience while being an administrator on SAMP, a community-made mass multiplayer mod for GTA San Andreas.
